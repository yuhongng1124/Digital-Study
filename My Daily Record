Since I have the Digital Electronics basic so I will started with verilog knowledge. The software that I have using was Icarus verilog and GTK wave. This software is not as what I have learn before (click to open)
Instread, it required to using command promp (cmd) in my Windows PC. 

First of all, I am going to set-up the software. Add the iverilog path into 
environment variable (C:\iverilog\bin).

- using iverilog -v to check installation

It was very hard to spend time keep updating the progress. So, I will just make a recap on pass 2 weeks what I have done. Basically, for the Verilog I have successfull finished the fundamentals of Verilog includes some block
some example, functions, pipelines and so on. But don't have many opportunity to hand on the project. So, in the next 2 weeks I will going to find some project in order to enhance my understanding as well as train my verilog skills.
