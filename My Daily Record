Since I have the Digital Electronics basic so I will started with verilog knowledge. The software that I have using was Icarus verilog and GTK wave. This software is not as what I have learn before (click to open)
Instread, it required to using command promp (cmd) in my Windows PC. 

First of all, I am going to set-up the software. Add the iverilog path into 
environment variable (C:\iverilog\bin).

- using iverilog -v to check installation
